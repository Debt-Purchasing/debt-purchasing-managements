# Setting Up the Task Management Repository

This document provides instructions on how to set up and use the Task Management Repository.

## Prerequisites

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:Debt-Purchasing/debt-purchasing-managements.git
cd debt-purchasing-managements
```

## Task Management Structure

Tasks are organized by component and priority. To get started, create the following directory structure:

```bash
mkdir -p tasks/contracts tasks/backend tasks/frontend tasks/general
```

## Creating Tasks

1. Create a task file with a descriptive name:

   ```bash
   touch tasks/contracts/implement_debt_vault.md
   ```

2. Use the following template for task files:

   ```markdown
   # Task: [Task Name]

   ## Description

   [Detailed description of the task]

   ## Acceptance Criteria

   - [ ] Criteria 1

   ## Status

   ## Notes

   ```

## Tracking Task Progress

To track the progress of tasks:

1. Update the status in the task file
2. Commit and push changes
3. Use GitHub issues for discussion and tracking

## Coordinating with Component Repositories

While this repository tracks tasks, actual development happens in the component repositories:

- [debt-purchasing-contracts](https://github.com/Debt-Purchasing/debt-purchasing-contracts)
- [debt-purchasing-backend](https://github.com/Debt-Purchasing/debt-purchasing-backend)
- [debt-purchasing-frontend](https://github.com/Debt-Purchasing/debt-purchasing-frontend)

Link to relevant tasks in your commits and pull requests by referencing the task file path.
