# Debt Purchasing - Task Management

This repository serves as a centralized task management system for the Debt Purchasing Platform project.

## Project Overview

The Debt Purchasing Platform consists of three main components:

1. Smart Contracts (debt-purchasing-contracts)
2. Backend Services (debt-purchasing-backend)
3. Frontend Application (debt-purchasing-frontend)

Each component is managed in its own separate repository.

## Purpose of this Repository

This repository is used to:

- Track and organize tasks across all components

- `tasks/contracts/` - Tasks related to smart contracts
